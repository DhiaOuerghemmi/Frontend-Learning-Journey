# Chapter 1: Basic Types, Arrays, and Tuples

## Overview
This chapter introduces fundamental TypeScript types, including primitive types, arrays, and tuples. Understanding these core concepts is essential for building robust and type-safe applications.

## Topics Covered
1. **Basic Types**
   - String
   - Number
   - Boolean
   - Other types (Any, Unknown, Void, Null, Undefined)
2. **Arrays**
   - Declaring and Initializing Arrays
   - Common Array Methods
   - Readonly Arrays
   - Multi-dimensional Arrays
3. **Tuples**
   - Defining Tuples
   - Accessing and Modifying Tuples
   - Optional and Rest Elements
   - Using Tuples in Functions

## Why These Concepts Matter
- **Type Safety:** Ensures variables hold only expected values.
- **Readability & Maintainability:** Helps developers understand code structure.
- **Error Prevention:** Reduces runtime errors by catching mistakes during compilation.

## How to Use This Chapter
- Each topic has a dedicated **README file** explaining concepts with examples.
- Code examples are provided in `.ts` files for hands-on learning.
- Follow the examples and experiment with modifications to deepen your understanding.
