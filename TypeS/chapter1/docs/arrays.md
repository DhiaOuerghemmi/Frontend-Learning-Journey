# Arrays in TypeScript

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in programming. In TypeScript, arrays not only hold collections of data but also benefit from static type-checking, which helps catch errors early and improves code quality.

## Declaring Arrays

There are two primary ways to declare an array in TypeScript:

### 1. Using the Type and Square Brackets

This is the most common way to declare an array when all elements are of the same type.

```typescript
// An array of numbers
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// An array of strings
let fruits: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
