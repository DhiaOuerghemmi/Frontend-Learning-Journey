# TypeScript Chapter 4: Utility Types & Advanced Type Manipulations

## Overview
This chapter explores TypeScript's built-in **utility types** and advanced type manipulation features. These tools help streamline type definitions, enforce consistency, and reduce boilerplate in your code. You'll learn how to use utility types to modify existing types, as well as create complex type relationships.

## What You Will Learn
- **Utility Types:** Learn about `Partial`, `Required`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`, and more.
- **Advanced Manipulations:** Explore conditional types, mapped types, and how to combine them for more expressive type definitions.

## Topics Covered
1. **Partial & Required**  
   - Making properties optional or mandatory
2. **Pick & Omit**  
   - Selecting or excluding specific properties from a type
3. **Record**  
   - Creating a type with a set of properties of a specific type
4. **Conditional and Mapped Types**  
   - Advanced techniques for dynamic type manipulation

## Why It Matters
Using utility types and advanced manipulations makes your code more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and maintainable. This knowledge is essential when building robust applications, especially as you move into frameworks like React and Next.js where component props and state management become critical.

## How to Use This Chapter
- **Read:** Study the explanations and examples in this README.
- **Practice:** Work through the code file examples to see how utility types can simplify your type definitions.
- **Adapt:** Apply these concepts to your own projects to enhance code maintainability and safety.
