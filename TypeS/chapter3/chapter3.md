# TypeScript Chapter 3: Advanced Types â€“ Union, Intersection, and Generics

## Overview
In this chapter, we delve into advanced type concepts in TypeScript. You'll learn how to work with **union** and **intersection** types to create flexible yet precise type definitions, and you'll master **generics** to write reusable, type-safe functions and classes.

## What You Will Learn
- **Union Types:** How to define types that can be one of several types.
- **Intersection Types:** How to combine multiple types into one.
- **Generics:** How to write functions, classes, and interfaces that work with any type while still maintaining type safety.

## Topics Covered
1. **Union Types**  
   - Definition and use cases  
   - Examples: Function parameters and variable declarations

2. **Intersection Types**  
   - Merging multiple type definitions  
   - Real-world scenarios: Combining object types

3. **Generics**  
   - Creating generic functions and classes  
   - Generic constraints and default types  
   - Examples in array manipulation and data structures

## Why It Matters
Mastering these advanced types is critical for writing scalable and reusable code. These concepts lay the foundation for handling complex data structures in larger applications and are essential skills before moving on to frameworks like React and Next.js.

## How to Use This Chapter
- **Study the Documentation:** Read through this README for a comprehensive explanation of each concept.
- **Review the Code:** Explore the accompanying code file to see practical examples.
- **Experiment:** Modify the examples to understand how advanced types can be applied to your own projects.

Happy coding and enjoy the power of advanced type manipulation! ðŸš€
